# Personal website
This web page project started with the idea to create a bussiness website for my dad who recently had the idea to start his own bussiness in rather unusual field of work, an engineer of smart home solutions with regards to water and heat regulation. Whether he will or will not start is yet now unknown, but the website idea was mainly a challenge for me. This is my first "real" project which focuses mainly on front-end developement skills. I am fully aware that the looks of this project aren't ideal, on the other hand it is not a copy of any other project. I have designed and coded the whole website by myself, thus it's obviously not perfect and i am fully aware of that. I used Figma to design and VScode to set the whole thing up.

I would still like to use this webpage as an example, however not so much of my skills, but rather dedication and willingness to learn new things and give them my free time. Web developement has truly become my obsession during the last half year and i am eager to discover and learn my skills. The whole page contains an unhealthy amount of "animations" however for me figuring how to "animate" and make things moving was the main focus during this project, as javascript is my biggest challenge at the moment.

I will gladly accept any objections regarding this project, as it really is the first "real" thing i have done on my own and without any prior education in this field.
